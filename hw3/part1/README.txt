Your lab directory is: C:\Users\cj917\Documents\courses\csc221\hw3

Inside your lab directory, you must create these directories:

 acrosomes
 bleat
 cantonal
 eyebrows
 fentanyl
 inferobranch
 lanital
 mellower
 persuasory
 undisputatious

For example:

$ cd C:\Users\cj917\Documents\courses\csc221\hw3
$ mkdir acrosomes

These directories are random words chosen based on your username.

Each file in your lab directory (e.g. file00003) contains a list of
random words, but each one contains one instance of each of the random
words you used to create your directories.

Each file must be placed in the directory whose name is contained in
the file.

E.g. if the word "acrosomes" is in the file "file00003", then you must move
that file "file00003" into the directory "acrosomes".

$ cd C:\Users\cj917\Documents\courses\csc221\hw3
$ mv file00003 acrosomes
