# Bash File System and Redirection

## Task 1
 
"To sort the file, use the 'sort' command which organize the data.
First, type 'sort shuffled-words.txt > shuffled-words-sorted.txt and press enter.
The '>' saves the output in the desired file which should be sorted out list"

## Task 2

"In order to get the list of the most common words, you'll need to sort the
file first with the 'sort' command. 
Then, use the 'uniq' command which will remove the words that were duplicated. 
After that, you'll use the 'head' command which will view the first 
10 lines of data.
After those commands, make sure the output is going into the common-words.txt file and press enter.
    Ex: sort|uniq -c|head -10 rand-words.txt > common-words.txt"

## Task 3

"You'll need to sort the file with 'sort'.
Then, use 'uniq' to get rid of the duplicated lines.
After that, use 'head' to get the first lines. 
Then, make sure output is going to common-numbers.txt and press enter.
    Ex: sort|uniq -c|head -10 rand-numbers.txt > common-numbers.txt"

## Task 4

"First, you will need to sort the file with the 'sort' command
and then use the 'uniq' command to get rid of the duplicated lines.
Next, use 'head' to get the first 10 lines and then use 'tail' to
get the last 10 lines. 
Then, make sure the output is going to common-2.txt and press enter
    Ex: sort|uniq -c|head -10|tail -10 rand-numbers-2.txt > common-2.txt"

## Task 5

"First, you will need to sort the file with the 'sort' command and
then use the 'uniq' command to get rid of the duplicated lines.
Next, use 'head' to get the first 10 lines and then use 'tail' to
get the last 10 lines.
Then, make sure the output is going to common-5.txt and press enter.
(I did not do this correctly but I tried.)
    Ex: sort|uniq -c|head -10|tail -10 rand-numbers-5.txt > common-5.txt
