I am think about creating another version of guess the number but instead it is guess the zip code. I give you the description of the location and you have to guess the correct zip code. 

I am going to use the mapit.py from Chapter 12 by using import webbrowser and argparse. I am also going to try the random module but I am not sure.

The sources I am going to be using is automate the boring stuff: Chapter 12 and invent with python book. I am also going to use stackoverflow.
